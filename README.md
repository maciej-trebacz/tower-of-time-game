## About

Tower of Time is a unique tower defense game that combines strategic building with time manipulation mechanics. When enemies overwhelm your defenses, use your time-travel powers to rewind and rebuild your strategy. The game features multiple tower types, energy management, and wave-based enemy spawning.

### Key Features

- **Time Rewind**: Roll back time to survive the enemy waves
- **Multiple Tower Types**: Basic turrets, sniper towers, slowdown towers, and splash damage towers
- **Energy System**: Manage energy for building towers and rewinding time

## Controls

Game supports both keyboard and gamepad.

- **Move**: Arrow Keys / Gamepad Analog Stick
- **Action**: Spacebar / Cross (PlayStation) / A (Xbox)
- **Rewind**: Backspace / Left Trigger

## Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Phaser 3 (v3.90.0) with Phaser Editor v4
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Development

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for package management)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (package manager)

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `pnpm dev` | Start development server |

## Vibe Coding Proof of Concept

This game serves as a proof of concept for AI-assisted game development. Approximately 95% of the codebase was written by AI using:

- **[Augment Code](https://augmentcode.com)** - Advanced codebase context and AI coding assistance
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** - AI-powered code editor, mostly using Agent mode
- **Claude Sonnet 4** - My LLM of choice for this project (also used OpenAI o3 and Claude Opus 4 occasionally)

The development process demonstrates how modern AI tools can accelerate game development while maintaining code quality and architectural consistency. For detailed prompts and development process, see [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md).

What I've learned:

- It is entirely possible to develop a game with AI, but you need to know what you're doing
- AI makes prototyping super fast, but as you transition from prototype to final game you need to be careful
- AIs like to write *a lot* of code, this project could probably have two times less code
- Claude Sonnet 4 knows Phaser.js pretty well but for key areas I've given it a URL to the docs for the specific feature I was working on and it helped
- If the AI gets stuck on something ask it to add debug/console logs and share them with the agent
- If after that it still gets stuck don't fight it, roll back everything and try rephrasing the prompt or giving it more context
